## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I Learned how to practically apply CSS to create a component of a website. I used the flexbox feature to adjust the layout of my component to my desire. I also style the fonts, colors, and the background of the page.

I learned a lot about flexbox and how to actually use it, and it's actually pretty simple, as simple as this part of the code
```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    /* align-items: center; */
}
```
